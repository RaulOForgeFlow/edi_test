    <!-- X2many fields expect to be populated by a list of three tuples, where the first value of the tuple determines
         the operation to be carried out. Within an eval attribute, we have access to a function called ref , which
         returns the database ID of an XML ID given as a string.
            -(2, id, False): deletes the linked record with id from teh database
            -(3, id, False): detaches the record with id , from the one2many field.
            -(4, id, False): adds a link to the existing record id. This should be what you use most of the time, usually
                             accompanied by the ref function to get the database ID of a record known by its XML ID.
            -(5, False, False): cuts all links but keeps the linked records intact
            -(6, False, [id,...]): clears out currently referenced records to replace them with the ones mentioned in the list of IDs.
