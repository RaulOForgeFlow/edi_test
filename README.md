# edi_test

This is a module to test the EDI exchange functionality using the UBL (Universal Business Language) format in three different main fields:

- Invoices (edi_account_move_ubl)
- Sales Order (edi_sale_move_ubl)
- Purchase Order (edi_purchase_move_ubl)

At the same time, it includes a testing library, where books can be sent and stored form one Odoo database to another. It has been used as a first trial and as a basis for the just mentioned SO, PO and INV.
